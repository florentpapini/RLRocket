# RLRocket

The main focus of this repository is to share the Rocket League bots with the community.
Theses bots are made with reinforcement learning using PPO. They are trained in a 2 vs 2 match where the agent is playing with and against copies of itself.

Below an exemple of the mean rewards for each episode which is 1000 steps.
